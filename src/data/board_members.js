    experienceTitle: "The Hair You Wear",
    experience: `I remember it like it was yesterday.  My daughter came to me before bedtime and asked if she could have her hair straight tomorrow for school.  She was in Kinder, just 5 years old, beautiful lush curls or twists is how she normally wore her hair.  I simply replied, sure.  I blow-dried her hair and put a few rollers at the end to give a soft curl.  Morning came, I was excited to see her new hairdo, excited to see her face of excitement for it, too.  Happiness?  Elation?  Excitement?  Joy!?!  I took off her hair scarf, took down the rollers, ran my fingers through her rolled curls to separate them and, VIOLA!  Beautiful, so I believed she would believe.  That was the last thing on her mind.  Her emotions were of Sadness, Anger, Annoyance and Frustration.  My little girl wanted her hair like all the other little girls in her class, she was being made to believe that her hair being different made her different, and she felt like she didn't fit in.  She cried, big crocodile tears, and then she said to me, “Mom, your hair is straight, too.” This was the beginning of my natural hair journey and the last time I permed my hair to keep it straight. 
      
Growing up, I was conditioned to not embrace my natural, curly hair and had never comfortably worn my curls, aside from walking around the house.  It hurt my heart to see, hear, and understand the perspective of a child's view of what beauty was based on what society tells us, what she sees around her, and what she emulates from her own home.

How would you feel growing up and only seeing images of people with straight hair?

How would you feel going in the store and not seeing any hair products to manage your hair?

What would you do if nothing around you looked like you? 

This is what I grew up in.  I emulated what was around, what I was taught was beauty.  This was not the life I wanted for my daughter.  I wanted her to LOVE the skin she was in and the hair she was given.  So, I cut my hair to 2 inches and our love for our hair started together!`,

    bio: "I'm Boston Native that made the move to eventually become a Seattleite in 2016.  I graduated from Massachusetts College of Art and Design to acquire a BA in Graphic Design. I most recently completed Lambda School's Full Stack Web Development program. I love to design and code and I'm happy to be able to use my talents to make a positive change. HUEmanistic means a lot to me because it's a chance to have a voice and to hopefully bring people, communities, and eventually the country together! Who knows maybe even the world? It's long overdue and I hope I can see this change in my lifetime. Let's make inequality a thing of the past!",
    experienceTitle: "The Talk",
    experience: `"You already have two strikes against you. You're a woman and you're Black."  This is the sentence that has followed me throughout life. The talk my mom gave me was quick and concise but left a lasting scar on my psyche. Once this realization was chained to my being it dominated the essence of who I was.  At that moment I was forced to reckon with the fact I was different. I was forced to acknowledge the fact that people wouldn't see me for who I was. I can't remember how young I was for sure when I had the talk. I know I cried and it scared me. I didn't want to be different. I didn't want people to think I was a bad person. 
    
  Along with this reckoning that I was being judged on what I am instead of who I am was the battle of self-acceptance. It's taken me a long time to get to a place where I'm not apologetic for being me. For being born in this skin. For finally not wanting to fade in the background and go unnoticed. I grew up quiet, shy and timid. I never fully came out of my shell. This fear of being judged, this fear of having to fit some supposed status quo. The fear of being seen as less than worthy, less than human. Just being seen and treated as less than.
  
  Growing up, society told me who I was supposed to be as a Black woman. Stereotypes put me into this box of expectations. I felt like these stereotypes were tethered to me and it's what people saw or expected before they got to know me. I tried to break away from expectations in ways often detrimental to myself. Being overly kind, overly nice, and agreeable to a fault so that I wouldn't come off as something I wasn't. I was overcompensating for things I couldn't control which often left me without the courage to stand up for myself when I needed to.
  
  "You already have two strikes against you. You're a woman and you're Black. You're going to have to work twice as hard for everything you get." The talk set up this expectation that life is hard, unjust, and unfair. As a child this seemed like an overwhelming challenge.  I was trying to figure out what life was and how I fit. This talk was a slap of reality telling me what my role was and I didn't have much choice in the matter. The talk didn't teach me how to navigate these challenges I would face. The talk didn't give me confidence in who or what I am. The talk felt like it robbed me of something that I couldn't get back. I get the talk is a necessary evil. But I hope there will be a day when the talk will no longer be necessary.`,

    bio: `Brandon was born in Columbus, Georgia, and raised in the rural southeast along the Chattahoochee River, that is shared with Phenix City, Alabama. Prior to his current role a Systems Engineer for Amazon, Brandon spent seven plus years as a full-time volunteer for a religious order based in New York after graduating K-12 in Russell County, AL, and spending four years studying computer science at Auburn University.

Brandon withdrew his support for and effectively detached himself from the fundamentalist religious order in 2017, at the age of 30, while undertaking a methodical deconstruction so as not to throw out the baby with the bathwater.
Brandon continues to believe that all life, regardless of race, color, species, religion, nationality, social position, economic condition, or other factors, has inherent worth and value.

Unfortunately, Brandon did not learn details about events such as the Tulsa, OK massacre until prompted to do research after viewing the 2019 TV mini-series Watchmen.

Brandon is a firm believer that current educational efforts, such as Critical Race Theory, are not attempts to erase, wash history, or proliferate racism, but rather an attempt to more objectively characterize it from a variety of perspectives (including the uncomfortable stuff) in order to avoid repeating our collective mistakes and effect positive systemic changes in our shared future.

Brandon expressed interest in volunteering time with a grassroots group that became HUEmanstic, as we know it today, during the outcry over the murder of George Floyd.

Brandon is passionate about establishing common ground amongst people, fostering curiosity, and bringing the community together despite their differences.`,
