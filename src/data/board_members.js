      "A Los Angeles Native trained in Design, Psychology and Pop Culture with a BA in art. I am currently a Campaign Manager and Marketer, amateur writer of books and do podcasts in my spare time. Being a person of color, I am intimately familiar with the inequities and injustice of a racist society with a violent and painful history. However, I do believe in the myth of the American Dream and I strive constantly to use every tool at my disposal to make that myth a reality for all. I joined HUEmanistic because I believe in what the organization represents, and I will use my skills and talents to aid in their mission.",

  //     "Inside Sales Supervisor, Business Development. Born and raised in Los Angeles with four years as a Georgia resident, I decided to attend college after getting burned out from the entertainment industry as a child actor. I eventually earned my bachelor's in Communications with an emphasis in Journalism and minor in English Literature from California Lutheran University. I started my first corporate job in academic publishing and eventually completed my MBA from Mount St. Mary’s University. My husband and I are Washington state residents as of 2016, and I’ve been working on the commercial side of aerospace with a focus on business development at Raytheon Technologies-owned Collins Aerospace.

Assistant and Copy Editor in Portland, OR. While attending CSU Long Beach, I interned for the NAACP, where I got my first dose of white privilege. No longer a part of the struggle, I stopped paying attention, and rarely followed up on police brutality cases. The recent murders have put our nation’s dirty laundry on display, and the numbers continue to rise. We are a broken country, and we need to unite in order to fix it.",

      "I'm Boston Native that made the move to eventually become a Seattleite in 2016.  I graduated from Massachusetts College of Art and Design to acquire a BA in Graphic Design. I most recently completed Lambda School's Full Stack Web Development program. I love to design and code and I'm happy to be able to use my talents to make a positive change. HUEmanistic means a lot to me because it’s a chance to have a voice and to hopefully bring people, communities, and eventually the country together! Who knows maybe even the world? It’s long overdue and I hope I can see this change in my lifetime. Let’s make inequality a thing of the past!",
